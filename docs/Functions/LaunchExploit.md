## LaunchExploit
The `LaunchExploit` function is responsible for injecting a specified DLL into the Roblox client. This function checks if the DLL is already injected, and if not, it attempts to inject it using an external injector executable.


### Syntax

```csharp 
public static bool LaunchExploit()
```

### Returns

- `bool`: Returns `true` injection was successfull otherwise `false`.


### Example

```csharp
if (!SirHurtAPI.SirHurtAPI.LaunchExploit())
{
    MessageBox.Show("Failed to inject SirHurt");
    Environment.Exit(0);
}
```

### Remarks

This function checks if the exploit is already injected. If not, it attempts to find the Roblox client window and starts an injector process.
If the injection is successful, it sets the injection status and updates the registry with the path to the exploit data.
